Code Review and Improvement Suggestions
Strengths
Clear OOP Structure:
The use of a base Animal class with subclasses is a good example of inheritance and encapsulation.

Functional File I/O:
The application correctly reads input files and writes the output report as required.

Areas for Improvement
Resource Management:

Suggestion: Use Javaâ€™s try-with-resources to automatically close file readers and writers, which improves safety and reduces boilerplate code.

java
Copy
try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fileName))) {
// processing code...
}
Similarly, apply try-with-resources for PrintWriter.

Exception Handling:

Suggestion: Instead of a generic catch block for IOException, consider handling specific exceptions and possibly logging errors more robustly.

Code Readability and Modularity:

Suggestion: Extract methods for repetitive tasks (e.g., a method to capitalize species names) to improve readability.

Improve variable naming (for example, use nameQueue instead of queue for clarity).

Regular Expressions:

Suggestion: Consider validating input lines more robustly and providing feedback or logging when an unexpected format is encountered.

Separation of Concerns:

Suggestion: Split the file I/O operations into separate classes (e.g., a FileManager class) to isolate concerns and make the code more maintainable.
